# Driving School Attendance Portal
My driving school in India did not have an efficient system of taking attendance for students. All students had to sign in on a piece of paper and people would lose this piece of paper often. 
It is a simple application aimed to allow people to sign in online and make the overall process more efficient for the driving school. Unfortunately, I had to close this down because it was unsafe to store personal information of people in a text file. \

# Technology Used
I mainly used Kivy, a Python framework to make this application.
